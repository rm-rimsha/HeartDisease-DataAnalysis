# Heart Disease Data Analysis
This repository contains the code and resources for analyzing and visualizing heart disease data. The data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis were performed using Python, and the visualizations were created using Tableau. The final output is a dashboard that presents key insights and trends in the dataset.

**Dataset**

The dataset used for this analysis contains information about various health metrics and indicators related to heart disease. The dataset required cleaning and preprocessing to ensure its accuracy and consistency before analysis.

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**

Python was used for data cleaning and preprocessing tasks. This involved handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and ensuring data consistency. The cleaned dataset was then ready for analysis.

**Data Analysis and Visualization**

The cleaned dataset was analyzed using Tableau to uncover key trends, patterns, and relationships within the data. The analysis focused on exploring heart disease prevalence, gender distribution, age correlation, and other relevant health metrics.

**Dashboard**

This dashboard offers a detailed analysis of heart disease, focusing on key metrics and trends derived from a comprehensive dataset. It begins with an overview section presenting key statistics such as total patient count, gender distribution, average age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and heart disease rate.

Subsequent pages delve deeper into specific aspects of heart disease, including its distribution, gender-based analysis, age correlation, chest pain types, cholesterol levels, blood sugar levels, blood pressure distribution, exercise-induced angina, ECG results, thalassemia presence, and major vessels.

Each visualization is designed to provide actionable insights, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding heart health policies, interventions, and patient care strategies. The interactive nature of the dashboard allows for easy exploration of the data.
